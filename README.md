## Mushroom Classification

This project focuses on solving a binary classification problem to determine
whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using classical machine learning techniques.

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Hard Voting (Ensemble)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The Decision Tree model failed to distinguish between classes and showed poor performance.
KNN achieved strong results with high recall and F1 score.
Naive Bayes delivered high accuracy with perfect precision.
The Hard Voting ensemble model provided the best overall performance with near-perfect accuracy.

## Notes
This project emphasizes model comparison, performance evaluation, and the use of
ensemble learning techniques in classical machine learning.
